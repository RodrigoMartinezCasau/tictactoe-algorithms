# TicTacToe Algorithms – Minimax + Variable Board Size

This project implements a complete TicTacToe game in Python using 
fundamental algorithmic concepts from the course:

- Multidimensional arrays
- Recursion
- Depth-first search
- Trees (game tree)
- Algorithm analysis
- Greedy decision making (final move selection)

The program supports:

 Player vs AI (3×3, with Minimax)  
 Player vs Player (board size 3–7)  
 Option to choose who plays first  
 Clean object-oriented structure with classes

## How to Run

From the root folder:

```bash
cd tictactoe-algorithms
python3 src/main.py

Or for the GUI mode:
```bash
cd tictactoe-algorithms
python3 tictactoe_gui.py
