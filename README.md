# TicTacToe Algorithms – Minimax + Variable Board Size

This project implements a complete **TicTacToe game** in Python using 
fundamental algorithmic concepts from the course:

- Multidimensional arrays
- Recursion
- Depth-first search
- Trees (game tree)
- Algorithm analysis
- Hash tables (optional minimax memoization)
- Greedy decision making (final move selection)

The program supports:

✅ Player vs AI (3×3, with Minimax)  
✅ Player vs Player (board size 3–7)  
✅ Option to choose who plays first  
✅ Clean object-oriented structure with classes

## 📌 How to Run

From the root folder:

```bash
cd tictactoe-algorithms
python3 src/main.py
